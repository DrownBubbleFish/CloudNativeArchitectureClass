= Lab 17 - Client-Side Load Balancing with Ribbon

[abstract]
--
Let's continue learning the components found in Spring Cloud to implement patterns for distributed systems.
We'll again use Spring Cloud Netflix to implement client-side load balancing with Ribbon.

In this lab, we'll do the following:

. Change the consumer application from link:../../session_05/lab_16/lab_16.html[Lab 16] to:
.. Use a `LoadBalancerClient`
.. Use a `RestTemplate` configured to resolve service names from Ribbon
. Test the new consumer versions against our local pool of producers
. Try swapping out the Ribbon load balancing algorithm
--

== Setup

. A completed `springbox-config-server` project has been placed in `$COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_17/initial/springbox-config-server` for your convenience.
In a terminal window, change to that directory, rebuild, and run the application:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_17/initial/springbox-config-server
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/springbox-config-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. A completed `springbox-eureka` project has been placed in `$COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_17/initial/springbox-eureka` for your convenience.
In a separate terminal window, change to that directory, rebuild, and run the application:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_17/initial/springbox-eureka
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/springbox-eureka-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. A completed `springbox-producer` project has been placed in `$COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_17/initial/springbox-producer` for your convenience.
In two separate terminal windows, change to that directory, rebuild, and run the application (on different ports):
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_17/initial/springbox-producer
$ mvn package
$ SERVER_PORT=8080 java -jar target/springbox-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
$ SERVER_PORT=8082 java -jar target/springbox-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. Ensure you have two instances of the producer service registered in Eureka:

== Using the `LoadBalancerClient`

. Change to the lab directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_17/initial/springbox-consumer
----
+
and import the project (via `pom.xml`) into your IDE of choice.

. In `io.springbox.consumer.ConsumerController`, replace the autowired `DiscoveryClient` with an autowired `LoadBalancerClient`:
+
----
@Autowired
LoadBalancerClient loadBalancer;
----

. Next, update `consume()` to use the `LoadBalancerClient`. It's API is a bit different from `DiscoveryClient`, so we'll use it to create a `URI` object which we'll pass to our `RestTemplate`:
+
----
@RequestMapping(value = "/", produces = "application/json")
String consume() {
  ServiceInstance instance = loadBalancer.choose("producer");
  URI producerUri = URI.create(String.format("http://%s:%d", instance.getHost(), instance.getPort()));

  RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
  ProducerResponse response = restTemplate.getForObject(producerUri, ProducerResponse.class);

  return String.format("{\"value\":%d}", response.getValue());
}
----

. Build the application:
+
----
$ mvn package
----

. Run the application:
+
----
$ java -jar target/springbox-consumer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. Using `curl`, test the consumer application and show that it is receiving values from the producers.
Also, watch the producers and observe that Ribbon is performing round robin load balancing across the two producers:
+
----
$ curl -i localhost:8081
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 11
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Date: Tue, 24 Feb 2015 05:47:33 GMTServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1X-Application-Context: consumer:8081

{
  "value": 5
}
----

== Using `RestTemplate`

. In `io.springbox.consumer.ConsumerController`, replace the autowired `LoadBalancerClient` with an autowired `RestTemplate`:
+
----
@Autowired
RestTemplate restTemplate;
----

. Next, update `consume()` to use the `RestTemplate`. We'll tell it to access the producer service by it's logical name:
+
----
@RequestMapping(value = "/", produces = "application/json")
String consume() {
  ProducerResponse response = restTemplate.getForObject("http://producer", ProducerResponse.class);
  return String.format("{\"value\":%d}", response.getValue());
}
----

. Rebuild the application:
+
----
$ mvn package
----

. Rerun the application:
+
----
$ java -jar target/springbox-consumer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. Using `curl`, test the consumer application and show that it is receiving values from the producers.
Also, watch the producers and observe that Ribbon is resolving the logical name on behalf of the `RestTemplate` and then still performing round robin load balancing across the two producers:
+
----
$ curl -i localhost:8081
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 11
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Date: Tue, 24 Feb 2015 05:47:33 GMTServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1X-Application-Context: consumer:8081

{
  "value": 5
}
